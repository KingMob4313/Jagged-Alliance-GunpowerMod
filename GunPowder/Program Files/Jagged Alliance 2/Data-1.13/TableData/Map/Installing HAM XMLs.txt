HAM comes packaged with several XML files showcasing its new features. 

There are two Zip Files:
	HAM Defaults.zip - Used for a HAM game.
	JA2 1.13 Defaults.zip - Used for a JA2 game, or for turning off HAM's XMLized features.

In each Zip file you will find:
	DynamicRestrictions.XML - Controls where militia can and cannot go.
	FacilityTypes.XML - Defines facilities and their effects.
	Facilities.XML - Places facilities on the map.

In the JA2 Defaults Zip file you will also find:
	DynamicRestrictions-AggressiveRoaming.XML - Free militia roaming over almost the entire map.
	DynamicRestrictions-StrictPerimeters.XML - Militia roaming only around home city.


You can simply extract either of the zip files to your "JA2\Data-1.13\TableData\Map" folder, to
activate Full HAM or JA2 Defaults as appropriate.

--------------------------

Switching Pre-Made XMLs:

HAM includes two ZIP files in this folder. Each file contains a set of XMLs that can be used to
change the behavior of the game without having to worry yourself about messing with individual
settings.

To get JA2 behavior, please copy the files from the included zip "JA2 1.13 Defaults", replacing 
the files in your JA2\Data-1.13\TableData\Map folder. You can also replace DynamicRestrictions.XML
with either of the supplied options, to activate a different "basic" mobile militia behavior.

To go back to HAM behavior, please copy the files from the included zip "HAM Defaults", replacing 
the files in your JA2\Data-1.13\TableData\Map folder.

Please do not mix and match these two separate sets of XMLs (at least, not the facility XMLs) 
unless you know what you're doing!
